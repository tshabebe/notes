## how to build UX

when building any kind of **ux** it is better to think of how the user would interact with your application and rank them with their corresponding values or actions for those particular **ui**, one method that i use to rank my elements or user flows is to use percentage. if the values of the ranks rank the same I would put them in the same navigation. and emphasis them based on their values. the one with the highest value of-course becomes more the center attention.

> as for how to make something the center of attention search for it

also remember to make rankings into consideration otherwise it defeats the purpose
